                        <h2>Afghanistan, Entrepreneurs’ Dream</h2>
                      </div>
      

                    <p class="card-text">Starting a business in a conflict-ridden area is difficult to reach your goal. However, the lack of amenities creates too many entrepreneurial opportunities. Afghanistan is one of those conflicted countries where everything is needed. Many people are finding Afghanistan as entrepreneurs’ dream as they see opportunities everywhere. One only needs to take advantage and run a business. They strongly believe that the success of every economy is attributable to innovation and social enterprise venture.

                      Change is hard. You need to draw on your mindset to come up with a different idea, and important than that, you need to know how to implement that idea. Ideas are worth nothing if you don’t know how to execute. To illustrate, if you have the idea of celebrating your friend’s birthday, it is worthless unless you turn it to reality. The point being, you will need to make a practical and actionable plan so that the value of your idea gets multiplied that lead to results.
                      
                      As might be expected, there are obviously many challenges to starting a business in Afghanistan. Even you will get used to it. It might seem like you have a pretty good idea at the time, and then it all went horribly wrong at once. But it doesn’t mean you are cut out to be an entrepreneur. You should understand that the only thing you need to do is to up your game in a big way. Hard times help you become a successful and better entrepreneur.
                      
                      Entrepreneurs are different and logical thinkers. They are a unique group of people with ideas about how to solve problems of society. They think of entrepreneurship as a journey which has no destination. They continue pushing themselves and seeking out the things that help their business to grow. They are confident enough to feel like they can accomplish anything.
                      
                      Doing business in Afghanistan help you learn to be willing to lose, to push, and to nail the implementation of your idea. “Of course, there are too many obstacles to promote your idea in Afghanistan,” says Ehsan Barakzai, senior partner at ALPHA Afghanistan. “Even in the country’s capital, the most developed part of the country, there are considerable deficiencies in power supply forcing inhabitants and business owners to run generators. Telephone and Internet crash most often, leaving most populace and businesses without service for hours. There is also a lack of trained labor force; you need to provide workforce training programs after hiring workers.”
                      
                      These challenges you experience give you the opportunity to fail. You will accept that failure is part of the process hence what matter is to use it to your advantage. Experienced entrepreneurs know that this failure is a space for new attempts and make them much like failure toward success. Some entrepreneurial tactics might seem completely impossible and outdated to pull off in Afghanistan. Some other firm strategies might even seem silly, yet they clear a path to success.
                      
                      On this journey, you are required to be passionate; there will be times when you invest a large sum of money and an excessive amount of time but don’t make an AFs. Your passion helps you to keep going. Everything can go wrong at once yet there are always substantial things you can do something about to get on the path to recovery. You will make action-based decisions as soon as possible to recover from difficult situations. That is how you progress by constantly taking action. The more you struggle, the more you come to understand and recognize what works and what doesn’t, the better your business will grow.  
                      
                      As an entrepreneur, you build and maintain a strong network with the people you seek to serve. You enjoy working with people as it probably gives you energy. Quality people will be there to support you along the way while leeches surround you with negative thoughts to bring you down. Don’t suppress your negative thoughts instead let them out and put all your focus on what brings you joy.  
                      
                      Afghan people who have passed three decades of war are determined that they will not go back to the chaos of before. Money is not their ultimate goal but to take part in the rebuilding of their country.
